## Project summary
GnoEVM aims to enhance the scalability and interoperability of blockchain technology by introducing an EVM-based core developed in GO. By connecting this core to multiple chains, we strive to broaden its applications beyond traditional blockchain boundaries. Deploying this core on gno.land will support the platform's growth and future expansion, paving the way for further development and industry-wide impact.

### Goals and deliverables
**Goals**
- Expand Usability: 
    - Enable GnoEVM to be versatile across multiple blockchain networks, extending its use cases beyond a single ecosystem.
- Support Growth: 
    - Strengthen gno.land's foundation, providing tools and resources to facilitate its evolution and adoption.
- Achieve Technical Excellence: 
    - Develop a highly functional, GO-based EVM core that meets industry standards for security and performance.
**Deliverables**
- GO-Based EVM Core:
    - A fully functional, tested core that can be deployed on gno.land, supporting interoperability with various blockchain networks.
- Documentation: 
    - Comprehensive technical documentation for easy integration, maintenance, and potential future development.


### Impact on gno.land’s developer ecosystem

**-  Enhance Compatibility:** By integrating GnoEVM, gno.land gains compatibility with the widely adopted EVM standard, allowing developers familiar with EVM-based tools to seamlessly deploy DApps on the platform without additional learning curves.

**- Broaden Developer Accessibility:** GnoEVM lowers entry barriers for developers from various ecosystems, making gno.land more accessible and inviting for a diverse range of blockchain developers, ultimately enriching the platform’s community and ecosystem.

**- Expand DApp Diversity: **The addition of GnoEVM enables gno.land to support a broader variety of decentralized applications, fostering an environment that can host new and innovative solutions.

**-**** Drive Ecosystem Growth: **By opening the platform to existing EVM-compatible applications and tools, GnoEVM accelerates gno.land’s growth, establishing it as a competitive and developer-friendly blockchain platform in the industry.

### Timeline and milestones

**November (3rd Week) – December (1st Week):** Modify the existing EVM core for compatibility and deployment on gno.land.
**December (2nd Week) – January (3rd Week): **Test the EVM core on gno.land, collect feedback, and implement required adjustments.
**January (4th Week) – February (4th Week):** Develop comprehensive documentation for gno.land GoEVM.
**March and Beyond:** Conduct ongoing maintenance and support for gno.land GoEVM
